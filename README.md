## Solving Katas with Test Driven Development + Functional Programing

I'm practicing Test Driven Development and Functional Programing at the same time, while stealing Kata's from [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com).

[Link with me on codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/williamrmyers)

So the process is:

1. Pick a Kata
2. Write the tests to validate the Kata
3. Write the solution
4. Refactor to beautifly readable point free functional code.


## How To Use

```
git clone https://github.com/williamrmyers/Katas_TDD_and_Functional_Programing
npm install
npm test
```
