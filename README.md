## Solving Katas with Test Driven Development + Functional Programing

I'm practicing Test Driven Development and Functional Programing at the same time, while stealing Kata's from codewars.com,

So the process is:
```
1.Pick a Kata
2.Write the tests to validate the Kata
3.Write the solution
4.Refactor to beautifly readable point free functional code.
```

## How To Use

```
npm install
npm test
```
